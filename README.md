Wordpress site needs a fast theme for better ranking in Google. Problem with free themes is that nice ones load slowly, and those which are fast are ugly. Paid ones should be better, right? WRONG. And to test them on your site, you have to pay for them first. Solution: I though, I could write a theme over the weekend. It took me way more time, but getting 99% score in Google Speed Test was satisfying.
